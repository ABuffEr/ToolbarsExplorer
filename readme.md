This add-on makes easier to use toolbars in applications, providing an exploration model derived by object navigation, with simplified gestures.

## Commands

* Alt+applications: starts toolbars exploration (you can remap it via NVDA gesture manager);
* Left/right arrow: moves to previous/next toolbar;
* Up/down arrow: scrolls up/down items in current toolbar;
* Space/enter: activates toolbar item;
* Escape: exits from exploration.

Additionally, during exploration, you can perform actions on objects using any gesture provided by NVDA, as exactly as when you move to objects with standard object navigation.

## Note

Exploration terminates explicitly pressing escape, and implicitly performing an action on toolbar or its item.
